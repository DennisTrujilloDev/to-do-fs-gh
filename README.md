Use this web application to write down your daily list of to dos. You don't have to worry about accidentally deleting them, as the data is stored on an online database! 
In order to delete a to-do item, the user must first click and cross out the item, then click "Clear Task".

# <strong>How It's Made:</strong>
<strong>Tech used</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

This application stores data on MongoDB then retrieves it in order to display it to the user. Express is used as a framework in order to simplify node.   

# <strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>
I am practicing incorporating the back end into all sorts of mechanisms. For example, I was able to filter through certain to-do items on Mongo in order to delete them, similarly to how I was doing that on the front end.
